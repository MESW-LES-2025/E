# Frontend README

Our frontend is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React framework that enables the development of React applications with ease.

We also use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to add static typing to our JavaScript code, improving type safety and developer experience.

## Running the Development Server

For setting up the development environment, refer to the main [`README.md`](../README.md#quick-setup) file in the root directory.

To run the development server, follow these steps:

1\. **Navigate to the `frontend` directory.**

```bash
cd frontend
```

2\. **Run the following command:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Next.js development server, and you can view your application in the browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Available Scripts

In the `frontend` directory, you can run the following scripts:

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint to check for code quality issues.
- `npm run format`: Formats the code using Prettier.
- `npm run test`: Runs the available unit tests using Jest.

## Styles and premade components

This project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

As for reusable components, you can use [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components), which is a set of prebuilt and prestyled components that you can import and pass properties to.
